      <description>I always enjoyed comics since I was little. I did not get the opportunity to read Marvels or DC like others have. I grew up reading sonic and some alien comics. After that I got heavily into playing video games so I barely touched any comics and read mostly manga. In the past year I ran across this store Third Eye Comics and got exposed to the Alien and Predator comics.</description>

      <description>I bought Alien Defiance issue #1 months ago but, never got around to reading it. After going through the first issue, I got hooked. I was unable to find the second one in any local bookstores and the local comic store. I was forced to buy the digital version from Darkhorse. I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a fan of the digital versions but, I wanted to read them right away.I have to say I was hooked right away with this series.</description>

      <description>With the release of Fedora 26, I decided to upgrade my Fedora 25. Fedora 26 introduced a lot of cool things and I have been using the beta version on my work laptop. You can do upgrade by doing the following: * sudo dnf install fedora-upgrade * sudo fedora-upgrade
And just let all the packages go! then restart. I use the KDE version since I prefer it over GNOME.</description>

      <description>So you have an idea what is ansible and what you can do with it. After creating, playbooks &amp;amp; roles and dynamic inventories, you are wondering how you can centralize and control access to your playbooks. You can do this with ansible core and limit access and permissions on the git project. You can include all the playbooks, roles and inventory files in the same repo. But, this can become a problem once the project is git clone into the controller and anyone access to the server can potentially be able to access your playbooks.</description>

      <description>After being able automate user creation/deletion, I tackle on how to automate the Cloudera CM install as much as possible. I first started trying to install the rpms with ansible. I discovered the yum and repo modules. They allow me to add a repo and install any rpm available. This what I have:
- name: Add the cloudera-cm repo. yum_repository: name: cloudera-cm description: cloudera-cm repo baseurl: &amp;quot;{{ rpm_repo }}&amp;quot; # http://archive.</description>

      <description>Recently I installed Fedora 25 to test some playbooks and other configurations. A co-worker mentioned to use Vagrant but, my exposure was minimal. I only used vagrant to test some applications such as netbox and it uses Virtualbox by default. Previously I have used Virtualbox and Vmware but, I decided to move away from those. First, Virtualbox breaks everytime there is a kernel update. Although there is some commands you can run to recreate the kernel it needs but, why I should do this all the time?</description>

      <description>After I was able to successfully Install Cloudera CM and create a cluster, I was trying to find a way to reduce the deployment time. The current deployments would take too long, waste over 500 of labor hours and no consistency. I could not meet customer demand for new datanodes or clusters and had a reduced workforce due to contract changes. At first I tried to find an all solution like puppet or foreman.</description>

      <description>Openstack can be a great solution due to the increase demand of cloud and more resources. But, it can&amp;rsquo;t resolve every issue out there. an Openstack deployment can provide &amp;ldquo;unlimited&amp;rdquo; resources but, is useless if is not architectured for the specific applications that the VM&amp;rsquo;s will be hosting. For example, a previous customer had over 20 regions, configured almost the same and had performance issues. This customer hosted big data applications (Cloudera to be specific) on those VM&amp;rsquo;s, had an older deployment of Openstack ( Icehouse so we could not take advantage of the newer cloud features) and no budget for further expansion and upgrades ( Including software and hardware) but, had the following issues:</description>
