      <description>After being able automate user creation/deletion, I tackle on how to automate the Cloudera CM install as much as possible. I first started trying to install the rpms with ansible. I discovered the yum and repo modules. They allow me to add a repo and install any rpm available. This what I have:
- name: Add the cloudera-cm repo. yum_repository: name: cloudera-cm description: cloudera-cm repo baseurl: &amp;quot;{{ rpm_repo }}&amp;quot; # http://archive.</description>

      <description>After I was able to successfully Install Cloudera CM and create a cluster, I was trying to find a way to reduce the deployment time. The current deployments would take too long, waste over 500 of labor hours and no consistency. I could not meet customer demand for new datanodes or clusters and had a reduced workforce due to contract changes. At first I tried to find an all solution like puppet or foreman.</description>

      <description>Openstack can be a great solution due to the increase demand of cloud and more resources. But, it can&amp;rsquo;t resolve every issue out there. an Openstack deployment can provide &amp;ldquo;unlimited&amp;rdquo; resources but, is useless if is not architectured for the specific applications that the VM&amp;rsquo;s will be hosting. For example, a previous customer had over 20 regions, configured almost the same and had performance issues. This customer hosted big data applications (Cloudera to be specific) on those VM&amp;rsquo;s, had an older deployment of Openstack ( Icehouse so we could not take advantage of the newer cloud features) and no budget for further expansion and upgrades ( Including software and hardware) but, had the following issues:</description>
