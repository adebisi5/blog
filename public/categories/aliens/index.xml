      <description>I always enjoyed comics since I was little. I did not get the opportunity to read Marvels or DC like others have. I grew up reading sonic and some alien comics. After that I got heavily into playing video games so I barely touched any comics and read mostly manga. In the past year I ran across this store Third Eye Comics and got exposed to the Alien and Predator comics.</description>

      <description>I bought Alien Defiance issue #1 months ago but, never got around to reading it. After going through the first issue, I got hooked. I was unable to find the second one in any local bookstores and the local comic store. I was forced to buy the digital version from Darkhorse. I&#39;m not much of a fan of the digital versions but, I wanted to read them right away.I have to say I was hooked right away with this series.</description>
