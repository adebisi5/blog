      <description>Modding the PS3 can get quite confusing because the directions are not straight forward or can be confusing if you have not done this before or spend time trying to understand how everything works. At first I was confused but, with trial &amp;amp; error I was able to get it modded and installed homebrew and multiman.</description>

      <description>While trying to find emulators I ran into dolphin, pcsx2 and rpcs3. I was not sure which one to start on since I did not had the collection of games I used to have since I mostly went completely pc gaming and all my games are on steam or gog. I decided to start with ps2 games since they were cheaper to acquire( at least some games). I went to ebay and got dot hack infestation, AVP extinction and the DMC series.</description>
