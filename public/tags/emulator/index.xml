      <description>Modding the PS3 can get quite confusing because the directions are not straight forward or can be confusing if you have not done this before or spend time trying to understand how everything works. At first I was confused but, with trial &amp;amp; error I was able to get it modded and installed homebrew and multiman.</description>

      <description>I started using OBS to stream but, I noticed that in most games it uses a lot of CPU so the games start to stutter and the audio gets cut off. I started googling around and saw an article from gamingonlinux.com on how to use the GPU for streaming instead of the CPU. Of course I ran into a lot of issues since I been noticing more and more lately that most linux desktop or gaming is build with debian/ubuntu/arch in mind and fedora usually lags behind.</description>

      <description>While trying to find emulators I ran into dolphin, pcsx2 and rpcs3. I was not sure which one to start on since I did not had the collection of games I used to have since I mostly went completely pc gaming and all my games are on steam or gog. I decided to start with ps2 games since they were cheaper to acquire( at least some games). I went to ebay and got dot hack infestation, AVP extinction and the DMC series.</description>

      <description>AVP Extinction was a game that I really enjoyed when it came out. One of my favorites IP together in a strategy type game. Nothing better than building a horde of aliens and have your own hive that destroys everything and drags the bodies back to the hive to get turned into more aliens or pre-aliens. I been able to play most of this game on pcsx2 but, I had to use windows :( because getting to build successfully in linux is a pain and you need to install a lot of i.</description>
