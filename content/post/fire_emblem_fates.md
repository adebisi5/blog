#Fire Emblem Fates Birthright


The combat is straightforward just like any turn based RPG game out there. It follows the same style as the previous games and similar to the older ones. I reached to around chapter 13 and noticed I have missed a lot of the games features and cool stuff. Like I have barely build out any of the relationships or checkout the special kids besides the generic kids. At first I wanted to marry Camilla but, later on I noticed that I can't do that on this path. So I build out a relationship with Rinkah since she was tough and wanted to see what other benefits you get from marriage. Although you only get the generic kid with Rinkah, I did enjoy how her whole attitude and shyness went away. She went from being rough, defensive to a sweet heart.


I always forgot to feed lilith until I got to the first invansion and noticed how helpful she is. I'll make sure to feed her from now on!
