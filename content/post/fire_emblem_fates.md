#Fire Emblem Fates Birthright

The combat is straightforward just like any turn based RPG game out there. It follows the same style as the previous games and similar to the older ones. I reached to around chapter 13 and noticed I have missed a lot of the games features and cool stuff. Like I have barely build out any of the relationships or checkout the special kids besides the generic kids. At first I wanted to marry Camilla but, later on I noticed that I can't do that on this path. So I build out a relationship with Rinkah since she was tough and wanted to see what other benefits you get from marriage. Although you only get the generic kid with Rinkah, I did enjoy how her whole attitude and shyness went away. She went from being rough, defensive to a sweet heart.


I always forgot to feed lilith until I got to the first invansion and noticed how helpful she is. I'll make sure to feed her from now on!




#Fire Emblem Fates conquest

I still enjoyed conquest but, its harder to create relationships and earn gold ) the obvious difference between the two different decisions). It was kind of cool seeing this side of the game and how enraged and mad the other side of the family were when you decided to betray em. The madness that came from Ryoma and Takumi through out different chapters. How upset and how many times they tried to take you down...

I was very surprised on how some of the characters actually die... for example, during one of the rebellion's how they tore Scarlet to pieces...
