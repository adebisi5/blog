You can easily follow the instructions on rpmfusion on how to install the nvidia drivers on fedora but, it can be somewhat confusing if you don't follow the instructions exactly. By installing the repo then doing the commands posted on the instructions can give you a lot of headache if you don't really pay attention. What I mean by this is that you really have to make sure you install the correct driver for your GPU. You can't just install the Legacy GeForce on your GTX 755 TI and hope everything works out of the bat. If you are not sure which one to install then you need to figure out what GPU you have and match it with the list of GPU's supported and find out what driver is the correct one. For example, my GTX 755 TI is in the current GeForce/Quadro/Tesla [list](http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/367.57/README/supportedchips.html) Then follow the rest of the instructions.
