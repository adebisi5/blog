title: Upgrading Fedora 25
---
With the release of Fedora 26, I decided to upgrade my Fedora 25. Fedora 26 introduced a lot of cool things and I have been using the beta version on my work laptop. You can do upgrade by doing the following:
* ``` sudo dnf install fedora-upgrade ```
* ``` sudo fedora-upgrade ```

And just let all the packages go! then restart. I use the KDE version since I prefer it over GNOME.
