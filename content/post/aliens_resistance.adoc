In my https://jlozadad.io/post/aliens_defiance/[previous post] I discussed the Alien's Defiance comic series and I'm real excited to know that http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/Zula_Hendricks[Zula Hendricks] was brought back on another comic series! This time she will be on https://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/3004-092/Aliens-Resistance-1[Aliens Rsistance] working together with Amanda Ripley. When I saw this online I really freak out

 Because I was expecting not to hear about Zula anymore and never see her anymore. Although they should make a movie or anime series about her and Amanda or even better a movie. Something similar how the Gozilla series have been done in netflix. Its only a few weeks until it gets release and I'm going to try to get it right away. I only get the digital versions If I can't find a specific issue.
