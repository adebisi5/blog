In my previous post[https://jlozadad.io/post/aliens_defiance/] I discussed the Alien's Defiance comic series and I'm real excited to know that http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/Zula_Hendricks[Zula Hendricks] was brought back on another comic series! This time she will be on https://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/3004-092/Aliens-Resistance-1[Aliens Rsistance] working together with Amanda Ripley. When I saw this online I really freak out
