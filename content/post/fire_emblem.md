# Fire Emblem on 3DS

A while ago my sister mentioned that she is going to get Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright. I always enjoyed the Fire Emblem series but, its been a while since I played one. Probably back in gamecube times ) can't recall). I started playing Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright and been enjoying the story so far. Most of my favorites characters are on the birthright side, specially that you can spend more time with them and build out the relationships. After a while of playing I wanted to try out from the conquest side. This side has cool characters also but, I felt that with the birthright characters I was able to make a better connection. Although I do enjoy the characters on both side. I guess it depends if I feel like playing the more nice side or more evil hidden side. After playing this games for a while I wanted to try the other fire emblem games. I ordered awakening and pre ordered warriors.
