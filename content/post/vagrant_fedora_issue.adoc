I have used vagrant before to test servers and ansible content but, I stopped using it for a while. I usually try to update to latest versions and use the `libvirt` plugin. After updating to the latest version (2.2.1) I was unable to use vagrant with libvirt. Started getting this errors:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt                                                                             10864  19:15:16 
Installing the 'vagrant-libvirt' plugin. This can take a few minutes...
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
Bundler, the underlying system Vagrant uses to install plugins,
reported an error. The error is shown below. These errors are usually
caused by misconfigured plugin installations or transient network
issues. The error from Bundler is:

ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

To see why this extension failed to compile, please check the mkmf.log which can be found here:

  /data/vagrant_home/gems/2.4.4/extensions/x86_64-linux/2.4.0/ruby-libvirt-0.7.1/mkmf.log

extconf failed, exit code 1

Gem files will remain installed in /data/vagrant_home/gems/2.4.4/gems/ruby-libvirt-0.7.1 for inspection.

```

I googled around for a solution and found this that worked:

`CONFIGURE_ARGS="with-libvirt-include=/usr/include/libvirt with-libvirt-lib=/usr/lib" vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt`

Looks like others have reported this and used this as a workaround but, I'm not sure if its a bug or a permanent fix has been done.
