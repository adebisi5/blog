I always enjoyed comics since I was little. I did not get the opportunity to read Marvels or DC like others have. I grew up reading sonic and some alien comics. After that I got heavily into playing video games so I barely touched any comics and read mostly manga. In the past year I ran across this store [Third Eye Comics](http://www.thirdeyecomics.com/) and got exposed to the Alien and Predator comics. I always loved this series and being able to see more stories outside the movies completes me. I first started with Aliens Omnibus #1, #2 and #3.
